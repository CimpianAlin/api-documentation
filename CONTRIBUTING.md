# Contributing to our API

First of all: thank you very much for helping us out! Since this is both a documentation and also a very normative document for application developers to use for developing diaspora\* applications, contributing has some rules, depending on what do you want to contribute.

## Things you need to know before contributing

If you want to get in touch with other diaspora\* developers, [check our wiki][how-we-communicate] for information on how we communicate. Feel free to ask if you have any questions!

As with the main diaspora\* repository, everyone interacting with our code, issue trackers, chat rooms, mailing lists, the wiki, and the Loomio group is expected to follow the [diaspora\* code of conduct][code-of-conduct].

## Report a security issue

Found a security issue in some parts of the API or its implementation? Please disclose it responsibly. We have a team of developers listening to [security@diasporafoundation.org][sec-mail]. The PGP fingerprint is [AB0D AB02 0FC5 D398 03AB 3CE1 6F70 243F 27AD 886A][pgp].

## Fix spelling or grammar issues

Feel free to open a pull request right away if you find any spelling or grammar issues in these documents.

## Suggesting new routes or requesting field changes

If you want to suggest new routes or you want to add or remove fields in requests/responses, please open an issue *before doing anything else*. Try to describe you idea and why you think the diaspora\* API should change as close as possible. Most changes will have to get discussed in a larger group before implementing them, so it's important to start those discussions before writing any specifications.
